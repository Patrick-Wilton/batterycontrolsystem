# Notes

## Optimiser Inputs and Outputs
* ### Inputs
    * 24 Hour Forecast Including:
        * time interval and hence total number of values
        * house load for 24 hours (kW)
        * solar readings for 24 hours (kW)
        * import tariff for 24 hours ($ / kWh)
        * export tariff for 24 hours ($ / kWh)
    * Battery Model Including:
        * max capacity (kWh)
        * depth of discharge limit (typically 0% e.g. 100% SOC)
        * charging_power_limit (kW)
        * discharging_power_limit (kW)
        * charging_efficiency (ideally = 1)
        * discharging_efficiency (ideally = 1)
        * throughput_cost
        * initial_state_of_charge (optional, default = 0)
    * Objective Function Parameters (can be one of the following)
        * Financial
        * Energy
        * Peak
        * Quantised Peak
        * Dispatch
    
* ### Outputs (all 24 hours worth of values)
    * SOC VALUES
        * Storage SOC
        * Increase in SOC at each time step
        * Decrease in SOC at each time step
    * BATTERY POWER VALUES
        * Increase in battery SoC from the Grid (charge from grid)
        * Increase in battery SoC from PV Generation (charge from PV)
        * Satisfying local demand from the battery (discharge from house load)
        * Exporting to the grid from the battery (discharge from grid)
    * NET GRID VALUES
        * Net import from the grid
        * Net export from the grid
    * PEAK VALUES
        * Peak import power (connection point)
        * Peak export power (connection point)
        
## Settings to be moved to configuration file:
* Server Specific:
    * battery capacity
    * initial SOC
    * solar + house load data file name
    * IP addresses, ports, and register addresses
* Driver Specific
    * Server IP addresses, ports, and address values
    * Pub Drivers IP addresses and ports
    * Pub Drivers time settings
    
## System Assumptions
* Data in servers in the form of Watts (not kW) due to being int16 values
* It is possible to write power values directly to the battery server
